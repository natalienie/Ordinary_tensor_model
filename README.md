# Ordinary_tensor_model
this is a basic tensor_model: which does not takes importance of sequence of each batch of data
so this is not a good choice for the time series data
just to practice the model and train of tensor.
i flatted out the (len, 128, 2) feature shape to (len, 256) since i don't know whether tensor could
take data of such shape????
This is my major confustion about tensor, pls someone tell me ......Many thanks
